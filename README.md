# Software Testing.
 
#### Repository created for sharing exercises performed in the software testing discipline.
#### In the software testing discipline we start by seeing assertions in simple unit tests, as well as their particularities as float assertions using delta and other return types.

#####*Then we move to mocking using the mockito framework with jUnit5, using mockito always aiming to mock more than one interface, for better handling of the tested class.
