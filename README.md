# Software Testing.
 
#### Repository created for sharing exercises performed in the software testing discipline.
#### In the software testing discipline we start by seeing assertions in simple unit tests, as well as their particularities as float assertions using delta and other return types.
* Then we move to mocking using the **mockito** framework with jUnit5, using mockito always aiming to mock more than one interface, for better handling of the tested class.
* Then we started with white box tests and coverage criteria with line coverage and then branch coverage.
* We still go through mutation tests followed by analyzing and implementing tests for the detection of mutants.
* Also addressing system integration testing.
* Soon after we started with black box tests, using equivalence classes and threshold analysis.
* The next topic was black box testing and decision table, where through a table that is generated based on the class to be tested and from it the test cases are generated.
* The next was system tests using the selenium webdriver framework, where tests were generated for different sites with assertions and without as well.
* And Finally, model-based testing, which consists of analyzing a model (normally a machine state diagram) and generating test cases from it.
